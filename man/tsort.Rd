\title{ topological sort of vertices of a digraph }
\description{
returns vector of zero-based indices of vertices
of a DAG in topological sort order
}
\usage{
tsort(x) # now x assumed to be Bioconductor graph graphNEL
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ instance of class graphNEL from Bioconductor graph class}
}
\details{
calls to the topological\_sort algorithm of BGL.  will check in BGL
whether the input is a DAG and return a vector of
zeroes (of length length(nodes(x))) if it is not.  Thus this function can be used to check for
cycles in a digraph.
}
\value{
a numerical vector enumerating vertices in the
topological sort sequence, 0-based
}
